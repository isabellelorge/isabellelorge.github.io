	<p><br> I investigate pragmatic inferences in word learning. 
  Pragmatic inferences are inferences that listeners make about the meaning of words using contextual information 
  and/or what they know about the speaker's communicative intentions and constraints (e.g., cost/effort) 
  when the linguistic input itself is not enough 
  (which is most of the time).
