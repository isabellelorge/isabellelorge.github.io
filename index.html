	<p><br>I'm a third year PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge. My supervisor is
	Dr. Napoleon Katsos. My research focuses on pragmatic (context-driven) inferences for word learning in bilingual and monolingual children using human data and Bayesian models.<br> </p>

	<p> <br>Last April I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/"> Microsoft Research Cambridge </a> 
	and collaborated with <a href= "https://ast.io/"> Alex Taylor </a> from the Human Experience and Design (HXD) group and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nkushman/"> Nate Kushman </a> from the 
	Machine Intelligence and Perception (MIP) group on identification and understanding of context-specific features in dialog using deep learning networks.</br> </p>
	<p> <br>As a psycholinguist and a pragmatician, I am interested in both the formal and cognitive aspects of language processing, and where they potentially meet (i.e., artificial intelligence and computational models that try to describe linguistic behaviour).
