	<p><br>I completed my PhD in <a href= "https://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/staff-theoretical-applied-linguistics"> Theoretical and Applied Linguistics </a> at the <a href= "https://www.cam.ac.uk/"> University of Cambridge</a> with
		<a href= "https://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/dr-napoleon-katsos"> Dr. Napoleon Katsos</a>. My research focused on pragmatic (context-driven) inferences for word learning in bilingual and monolingual children using human data and Bayesian models.
	<p> <br>In April 2017, I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/"> Microsoft Research Cambridge </a> 
	and collaborated with Alex Taylor from the Human Experience and Design (HXD) group and Nate Kushman </a> from the 
	Machine Intelligence and Perception (MIP) group on identification and understanding of context-specific features in dialog using deep learning networks.</br> </p>
	
	<p> <br>As a psycholinguist and a pragmatician, I am interested both in how studying human behaviour can help us build better models but also in how models can give us insight into human behaviour.
        </br> </p>
	<p><br> Between 2020 and 2022 I developed novel NLP models for financial applications at <a href="https://www.arabesque.com/ai/"> Arabesque AI</a> 
		with a team of PhD graduates from top universities. My research areas included sentiment analysis in news and social media, 
		unsupervised learning and knowledge graphs. 
	<br> </p> 
	<p><br> I spent a year as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the e-Research centre (Engineering Department, University of Oxford) researching 
		semantic composition and polarisation in social media with <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/janet-pierrehumbert/">Professor Janet Pierrehumbert.</a> 
		I am now a Research Scientist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oxford working on the <a href="https://www.chronosig.org/">Chronosig </a> project, which aims to use state-of-the-art NLP to improve mental health triaging in secondary care.
