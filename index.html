	<p><br>I recently completed a PhD in <a href= "https://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/staff-theoretical-applied-linguistics"> Theoretical and Applied Linguistics </a> at the <a href= "https://www.cam.ac.uk/"> University of Cambridge.</a> My supervisor is
		<a href= "https://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/dr-napoleon-katsos"> Dr. Napoleon Katsos. </a> My research focused on pragmatic (context-driven) inferences for word learning in bilingual and monolingual children using human data and Bayesian models. (e.g., children asked to 'pick the wet gorp' in image below) <br> </p>

	<p> <br>In April 2017 I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/"> Microsoft Research Cambridge </a> 
	and collaborated with <a href= "https://ast.io/"> Alex Taylor </a> from the Human Experience and Design (HXD) group and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nkushman/"> Nate Kushman </a> from the 
	Machine Intelligence and Perception (MIP) group on identification and understanding of context-specific features in dialog using deep learning networks.</br> </p>
	<p> <br>As a psycholinguist and a pragmatician, I am interested in both the formal and cognitive aspects of language processing, and where they potentially meet (i.e., artificial intelligence and computational models that try to describe linguistic behaviour).
        </br> </p>
	<p><br> I currently work as AI Researcher Associate on portfolio optimisation using Natural Language Processing. 
	My research areas include sentiment analysis, unsupervised learning and knowledge graphs.
